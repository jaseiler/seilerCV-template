# seilerCV-template
Template for a Cirriculum Vitae. 
This is a latex template I created for my own CV. I had trouble finding templates I liked, so I hope other people can get some use out of it too!

Just download seilercv.cls.

in your .tex file start with \documentclass[11pt]{seilercv} 

compile with xelatex
